This is a 2D platformer I'm attempting to create one step at a time using Godot (GDScript)! 

I started by following this tutorial: https://youtu.be/wETY5_9kFtA

Then I decided that running and jumping is cool, but flying around with a jetpack is even cooler.

I was able to implement my own flying controls with some effort, and although the jetpack itself is invisible, it feels like it's there!

## Features so far:
<ul>
  <li>a boring map with no exit</li>
  <li>a sprite for the main character</li>
  <li>running animations</li>
  <li>ability to toggle jetpack on/off</li>
  <li>ability to fly when jetpack on</li>
  <li>jetpack fuel meter</li>
  <li>replenish jetpack fuel button</li>
  <li>tileset (ground/walls/ceilings)</li>
</ul>




## Features I'd like to implement next:
<ul>
  <li>a new background</li>
  <li>a main menu</li>
  <li>a welcome screen/initial screen</li>  
  <li>a help screen</li>
  <li>a demo level with objectives so players can see what game features exist</li>
  <li>flying animations</li>
  <li>create more animations and sprites</li>
  <li>
