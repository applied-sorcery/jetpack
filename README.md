This is a 2D platformer I'm attempting to create one step at a time using Godot (GDScript)! 

I started by following this tutorial:

Then I decided that running and jumping is cool, but flying around with a jetpack is even cooler.

I was able to implement my own flying controls with some effort, and although the jetpack itself is invisible, it feels like it's there!

Features so far:
-a sprite for the main character
-running animations
-tileset (ground/walls/ceilings)




Features I'd like to implement next:

-a new background
-a main menu
-implement a welcome screen/initial screen
-implement a help screen
-create a demo level with objectives so players can see what game features exist
-flying animations
-create more animations and sprites
-a good steering wheel that doesn't fly off while you're driving
